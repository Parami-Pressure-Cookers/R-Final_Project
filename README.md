## Description

This repository contains the final project for the **CS 251** course. We explored a [2019 sales dataset](data\raw\2019-sales-monthly) to uncover patterns, trends and relationships. The key questions we sought to answer were:

* **Question 1**: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* **Question 2**: What city has the highest sales?
* **Question 3**: What time should we display advertisements to maximize likehood of customers buying products?
* **Question 4**: What products are most often sold together?
* **Question 5**: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

The analysis was conducted entirely in **R**. We leveraged several key packages for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
